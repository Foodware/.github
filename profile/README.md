# Foodware: A Blockchain-Powered Food Distribution Network
Food” is a utility that fuels the human engine. Its systems have connected several civilizations via the adaptation and adoption of food culture. It is indeed a unique gift of nature as it is older than man’s existence. Its essentiality cannot be exaggerated as it is a medium that spreads love, peace, unity, and positivity. This essential need is always served with love from our families.

To our Sadness, this Commodity is turning into a financial Exploitation and manipulation medium instead of being improved for a better and more sustainable society. Agriculture, Transportation, Marketing, and availability play roles in global food distribution (Supply Chain).

There are tons of inconsistencies in the system due to profit-driven approaches to solving global food problems, and these constraints are currently hitting the continent of Africa hard despite its large expanse of farmable land.

Considering the adage "It is easier to make than to mend." we decided to create a regenerative and sustainable Ecosystem of Consumers, Vendors, Farmers, and Riders powered by Blockchain - The Foodware Network.

The Foodware Network is a DePIN Network built with a SHA Function Cluster/Algorithm for Secure Messaging and the Solana Blockchain through Smart Contracts for Transactions and Authentications.
## The Foodware Network
The Foodware Network is a Simulated Real-Life Food Marketplace built on a DePIN Network of Transport Vehicles, and it completes and tracks the movement of food from farm/store to plate with the help of its Layered Network System. Primarily, Foodware has three integral components; A Simulated Marketplace (Web2 Software), A Proof-of-Authentication Cluster (Middleware), and Asset Router Solana Programs (DLT Software).
1. The Simulated Marketplace allows users (Buyers and Sellers) to choose & upload product specifics, bargain, use Marketplace Services, and buy/sell Products.
2. The PoA Cluster is a Secure Messaging Software for distributing Encrypted Information among Consumers, Vendors/Farmers, and Riders. It uses a Verification Model known as Proof-of-Authentication to ascertain whether or not Riders have received and delivered the purchased products.
3. Asset Routers are Solana Programs (Smart Contracts) used to hold funds as an Escrow, distribute rewards, and perform other programable functions. The Asset Routers and Solana Blockchain serve as Foodware Network's Value Layer for Programmability of Money.
## Foodware Logistics Technologies 
[Foodware Logistics Technologies Ltd.](https://linktr.ee/foodware_labs) is a Nigerian-based Blockchain-Powered Food Distribution Company with the mission of recreating a Regenerative and Sustainable Food Supply Ecosystem with Blockchain Technology. Foodware Logistics Technologies is building and opening the Foodware Network to all for a more inclusive and value driven food ecosystem. The Foodware Network is the first prototype of FoodFi - The Concept of Decentralized Protocols using Blockchain Technology to ensure Food Security of the Everyday Human.
